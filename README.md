✏️ ft_printf

Because putnbr and putstr aren’t enough

This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
information below) of the printf function.


Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.
Instructions

1. Compiling the library

To compile, go to the library path and run:

$ make

2. Using it in your code

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

#include "ft_printf.h"
